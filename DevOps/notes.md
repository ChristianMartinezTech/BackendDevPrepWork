## Pillars of DevOps
1. **Pull Request Automation**
2. **Deployment Automation**
3. **Application Performance Management**

### Pull Request Automation
The goal is that developers can tell very quickly whether the code is good or not. Automate test and gates for the pull request's code. Then the code has to go through the code review from a peer, product manager, or "code owner".

**What can you automate?**
* Automated test running with a CI provider, which gives developers confidence that the change does not break existing functionality
* Per-change ephemeral environments, which helps interested parties actually interact with the proposed change to ensure it solves all required business goals.
* Automated security scanning, which helps ensure that proposed changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities into the product.
* Notifications to reviewers automatically, so that the correct reviewers can quickly request changes to a pull request.
